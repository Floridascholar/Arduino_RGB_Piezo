# Arduino_RGB_Piezo
This project is dedicated as a tribute to the mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, a heinous hate crime against LGBTQ people of color. The project was designed by Rachelle Tan and Emily Brooks as part of the Physical Computing and Fabrication course at DHSI 2016. The final installation was a copper cardboard structure with the shape of Florida cutout and decorated with a rainbow of cranes to symbolize peace and the LGBTQ community. The elements included were an origami heart box that opened to reveal a big red button that when pressed started a rainbow light display that syncs with the first stanza of "What the World Needs Now" by Hal David and Burt Bacharach.
